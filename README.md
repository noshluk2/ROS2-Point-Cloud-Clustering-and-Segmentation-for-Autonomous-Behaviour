# ROS2 Point Cloud Clustering and Segmentation for Autonomous Behaviour
We will start with RTAB mapping, a powerful technique for creating accurate 3D maps using RGB-D cameras. Through hands-on projects, you will learn how to use this technique to generate high-quality point clouds from your own data.
Next, we will dive into the Kitti Dataset and explore how to use 3D lidars for object detection. We will teach you how to use advanced techniques for detectingÂ  objects in real-time, such as lidar-based segmentation and clustering.
We will also cover ROS2, an essential tool for visualizing and processing point cloud data. With ROS2, you will learn how to use rviz and PCL to create stunning visualizations and analyze your point cloud data with ease.
In addition, we will explore cylindrical and planar segmentation, two important techniques for extracting meaningful information from your point cloud data. Through a series of hands-on exercises, you will learn how to use these techniques to accurately identify and classify objects in your point clouds.
